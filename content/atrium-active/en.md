# Arrive with an idea, leave with a community

Over the last twelve years, MozFest has fueled the movement to ensure the internet benefits humanity, rather than harms it. This year, your part in the story is critical to our community’s mission: a better, healthier internet and more Trustworthy AI. Come and go as your schedule allows - the events, and sessions taking place at MozFest include important and critical work towards Trustworthy AI, alongside moments to reset, refocus, and refresh. Important work will be intertwined between a diversity of sessions (some away from Zoom), coffee breaks, self care, and tons of fun. Instructions for navigating around the festival can be found below. 

This is the MozFest Plaza, the central hub for all things Mozilla Festival. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate your way through the festival:

- **Browse On-Demand Sessions.** In the Schedule view (found on the left hand side of this page) you can filter sessions by Space, session format or by tag.. 

- **Create Your Own Watch List.** Once you’ve found a session that you would like to watch, you can watch from the Session page immediately, or click the ‘Add to My Schedule’ button to bookmark it for later. Once a session is added to your schedule, you will be able to see the sessions you’ve bookmarked by pressing the ‘My Schedule’ toggle on the main Schedule page.

- **Complete Activities On Your Own Time.** With hundreds of sessions and unique experiences, there is a lot to do at MozFest! Go at your own pace and take time to enjoy each activity. The MozFest program will be available until 25 June for all ticket holders, giving you plenty of time to explore.
