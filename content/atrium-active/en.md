MozFest House Amsterdam is a regional invitation for individuals, partners, allies, and initiatives to showcase their work within their local environment and experiences. House isn't just a date on the calendar – it's a vibrant convergence of minds, a celebration of creativity, and a catalyst for change in the digital world. Join us from 11-13 June 2024.

In 2024, urgent challenges await: 83 elections, ongoing conflicts, climate crisis, and AI’s impacts on jobs. Our theme for the year: Solidarity and Togetherness, aligns with envisioning a future prioritizing people and the environment. Together, we stand united, driving local change globally, prioritizing collective well-being over profit and machines, and reforming policies and tech for a better future.

## Thematic Focuses

The following thematic focuses for MozFest House Amsterdam 2024 were co-designed by the talented Mozilla Festival Wranglers. This diverse group of over 20 practitioners, activists, academics, and artists from across the region came together to explore and define solidarity and togetherness in the realm of trustworthy AI.
