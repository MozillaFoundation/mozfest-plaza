Over the last ten years, MozFest has fueled the movement to ensure the internet benefits humanity, rather than harms it. This year, your part in the story is critical to our community’s mission: a better, healthier internet and more Trustworthy AI.

Now that the festival is behind us, you can continue the MozFest experience until June 16, 2021 by accessing on-demand resources and recorded sessions. Instructions for navigating around the on-demand content of the festival can be found below.

## How to MozFest

%feature_video%

This is the MozFest Plaza, the central hub for all things Mozilla Festival. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate your way through the festival:

- **Watch Recorded Sessions**. We had 582 sessions being hosted over the span of our 12-day virtual festival! These sessions are sorted by Spaces. Think of Spaces at MozFest as mini-festivals each with their own unique theme. As you browse the schedule, you can filter sessions by Space, session format or by tag. You can watch the recording directly on the session’s page once you click on it from the main list.

- **Explore Art & Media installations and Skill Shares.**. Located on the left side of the Plaza, these aspects of the festival were always on-demand. From podcasts, to films, to mini-lessons, these are perfect experiences to sprinkle throughout your day.

- **Complete Activities On Your Own Time.**. Go at your own pace and take time to enjoy each activity. The MozFest program will be available until June 16 for all ticket holders, giving you plenty of time to catch up on what you may have missed.

- **Connect on Slack.**. The live festival may be over but the community is still thriving! All year long, the internet health community is on MozFest slack, continuing conversations that happened at the festival and beyond. After you watch a recorded session or experience an installation, drop in to the slack, say hello, and share your thoughts. Let’s keep the MozFest momentum going!

- **Use The Help Desk Button**. We’re here to help if you run into an issue, need help with the technology, or have a question that you can’t find the answer to.
