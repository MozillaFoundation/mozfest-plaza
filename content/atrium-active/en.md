# Arrive with an idea, leave with a community

Over the last twelve years, MozFest has fueled the movement to ensure the internet benefits humanity, rather than harms it. This year, your part in the story is critical to our community’s mission: a better, healthier internet and more Trustworthy AI. Come and go as your schedule allows - the events, and sessions taking place at MozFest include important and critical work towards Trustworthy AI, alongside moments to reset, refocus, and refresh. Important work will be intertwined between a diversity of sessions (some away from Zoom), coffee breaks, self care, and tons of fun. Instructions for navigating around the festival can be found below.

This is the MozFest Plaza, the central hub for all things Mozilla Festival. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate your way through the festival:

- **Browse The Schedule.** We have over 340 sessions being hosted over the span of our virtual festival! These sessions (interactive, community-led workshops, skills shares, engaging conversations, and hands-on activities) are sorted by Spaces. Think of Spaces at MozFest as mini-festivals each with their own unique theme. Multiple activities are scheduled at any one time so that even within a Space, attendees can choose their own adventure. As you browse the schedule, you can filter sessions by Space, session format or by tag, and add sessions to your schedule that you find most interesting. 

- **Create Your Own Schedule.** Once you’ve found a session that you would like to attend, click the ‘Add to My Schedule’ button to shortlist this session. To be able to access a session, you will need to add it to your schedule. Once a session is added to your schedule, you will be able to see the sessions you’ve shortlisted by pressing the ‘My Schedule’ toggle on the main Schedule page.
 
- **Access Sessions.** To access links to sessions first you will need to have added the session you want to attend to your schedule by pressing the ‘Add to My Schedule’ button on the session page. Once you’ve added the session to your schedule, the link to join will appear automatically 15 minutes before the session is due to begin. 

- **Watch The Live Stream.** At any given time during the Festival, you’ll be able to find a live stream here on the MozFest Plaza, where you can watch a selection of live and/or recorded sessions, special announcements, art and media pieces, or Dialogues and Debates sessions, just to name a few. The live stream will also be available to access on-demand later.

- **Complete Activities On Your Own Time.** You aren’t expected to participate in every hour of MozFest, which spans 12 hours each day over 4 days. Attend live sessions that work for your calendar and then choose on-demand activities that you can do in your own time. Go at your own pace and take time to enjoy each activity. The MozFest program will be available for 90 days after March 11 2022 for all ticket holders, giving you plenty of time to catch up on what you may have missed.
