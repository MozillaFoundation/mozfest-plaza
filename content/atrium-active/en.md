# Thank you for joining us!

Whether you joined us at MozFest Virtual or took part in MozFest House: Amsterdam, we want to say a massive thanks to you all - MozFest wouldn't be the same without the incredible community who brings it to life.

We hope you had a great time exploring the hundreds of sessions, art pieces, and lightning talks brought to you by our international community. For now, we're taking a short break as we close the Plaza. But, stay tuned – we'll be back for MozFest House: Kenya coming up in September 2023.
