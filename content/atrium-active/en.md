MozFest House Amsterdam is a regional invitation for individuals, partners, allies, and initiatives to showcase their work within their local environment and experiences. House isn't just a date on the calendar – it's a vibrant convergence of minds, a celebration of creativity, and a catalyst for change in the digital world. Join us from 11-13 June 2024.

In 2024, urgent challenges await: 83 elections, ongoing conflicts, climate crisis, and AI’s impacts on jobs. Our theme for the year: Solidarity and Togetherness, aligns with envisioning a future prioritizing people and the environment. Together, we stand united, driving local change globally, prioritizing collective well-being over profit and machines, and reforming policies and tech for a better future.
