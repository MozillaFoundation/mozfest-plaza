This is your personal Mozilla Festival schedule. It brings together the sessions youâ€™ve chosen as you explore the many conversations, workshops, and experiences happening across the festival.  

You can sync your schedule with your favorite calendar app using our [Calendar Sync feature](/sync-calendar) to receive reminders before your sessions begin.
