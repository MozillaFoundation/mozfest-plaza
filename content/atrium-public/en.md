# MozFest Plaza

Mozilla Festival brings together the world’s most curious and creative minds to make good on the internet’s original promise. From November 7 to 9, 2025, we gather in Barcelona to explore **Unlearning** and shape a more inclusive digital future. Together we will rethink defaults and imagine alternatives.

The festival is a community powered celebration of ideas, art, and action. It is where technologists, artists, activists, policymakers, educators, and everyday internet users meet to learn from one another and move good work forward. The energy comes from you. The program is shaped with our community of Wranglers and contributors who invite people to build, test, and share what is next.

## Tickets and Registration

## Thematic Focuses

Unlearning invites us to question habits, set aside past assumptions, and try fresh approaches. Across three days we will listen, reflect, and practice new ways of working so technology serves people and planet. This is how we make good together.
