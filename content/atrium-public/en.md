# Arrive with an idea, leave with a community


MozFest is a unique hybrid: part art, tech and society convening, part maker festival, and the premiere gathering for activists in diverse global movements fighting for a more humane digital world. Over the years, MozFest has fueled the movement to ensure the internet benefits humanity, rather than harms it. We remain focused in our work to build a healthier internet and more Trustworthy AI.
