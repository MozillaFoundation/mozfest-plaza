# Arrive with an idea, leave with a community


MozFest is a unique hybrid: part art, tech and society convening, part maker festival, and the premiere gathering for activists in diverse global movements fighting for a more humane digital world.

Over the last twelve years, MozFest has fueled the movement to ensure the internet benefits humanity, rather than harms it. As the festival matures, we remain focused on our work to build a healthier internet and more Trustworthy AI.

MozFest LIVE took place 7-11 March, 2022, and now continues as an on-demand platform until June 25 for ticket holders.  You can see an overview of the recorded sessions, Art & Media experiences, and Lightning Talks through the navigation on the left hand side of this page.

Secure your on-demand ticket now to access all on-demand content from MozFest, where the brightest minds and most ambitious ideas from the internet health movement have come together this year.

Our Fringe events will continue to expand and offer new ways to continue the work, sustain the momentum and continue the collaborations started at this year's event
