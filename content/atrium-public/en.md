MozFest House Zambia is a gathering for collective action towards achieving trustworthy AI. It is a call to action that centers Africans in the pursuit of Trustworthy AI systems. Working in solidarity with activists, policymakers, technologists, artists, and civil society actors to make a new normal for a future that listens and adapts, ensuring technology serves us all.

In the spirit of Mozilla Festival’s foundational theme of 'Solidarity and Togetherness’, MozFest House Zambia in 2024 is a platform to demonstrate the power of solidarity and the limitless possibilities we can achieve in unity with the world around us. Together, we can reclaim the power of AI and technology for the collective well-being of people and planet.

## Thematic Focuses

The following thematic focuses for MozFest House Zambia were co-designed by the talented Mozilla Festival Wranglers.
