### Directions To MozFest House Amsterdam Venue

[Tolhuistuin](https://tolhuistuin.nl/) is just across the River Ij from Amsterdam’s Central Station

Address: IJpromenade 2, 1031KT Amsterdam

  There is a free 24-hour ferry ([Buiksloterweg](https://reisinfo.gvb.nl/en/lijnen/F3/dienstregeling/heen) ferry) that runs continuously from the back of the station (Amsterdam Centraal). Once you step off the ferry you’ll see the Tolhuistuin building - head to the right of the building and **enter through the garden** - our friendly Volunteers will be ready to direct you.

### Registration Upon Arrival - go to the garden entrance

-   Upon arrival, you’ll be directed to registration by our team of Volunteers. **Registration and the main festival entrance is to the right side of the building**, NOT through the main doors at the front.
-   Have your QR code ready from your ticket confirmation email and the team will check you in and give you your festival pass. This pass gives you access to all areas of the festival for the duration of the event so please wear it at all times in the venue and garden.
-   At registration, with your festival pass, you will also choose a lanyard color that reflects your photo/video preference. A specific color is available for those who prefer not to be recorded.

### Accessibility

-   If you have any accessibility needs, you will be directed through the main building, where there is an elevator to the 1st-floor rooms, or direct access through the garden.
-   Once inside the Tolhuistuin building, all session rooms and restrooms are accessible, our volunteer team will also be on hand to assist you.

### Schedule

**You can see the** [full schedule here](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/plaza)  - spots will be available on a first-come first-served basis. If a session is full, don’t worry, you can take a look around our Ethical Dilemma Cafe, network in our Art & Social Space, or enjoy our garden installations.


Looking for a place to connect with others, get some work done, or just unwind between sessions? Check out the Garden, Art & Social space, or Ethical Dilemma Cafe! We've designed these spaces for you to relax, recharge, and connect with other attendees. Plus look out for our Hip Hip energizer on Wednesday and our garden breathing session on Thursday to allow some time to recharge!

#### Pre-festival Virtual Networking:

One of the highlights of #MozFest is meeting new people and making connections. Get a head start by joining our exclusive [Virtual Networking Event on Discord](https://discord.gg/qGBBGKqp?event=1234919356677492819) on 10 June at 12 pm CET!

### Opening hours (on-site)

-   **Tuesday, 11 June:**

-   **Wednesday, 12 June:**
	- We are open from 09:00 - 18:00. This is the first full day of our festival. **Our keynote session by Mona Chalabi, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and data scientist, starts at 11:00 CET.** You don’t want to miss it!

-   **Thursday, 13 June:**
	- The final day for MozFest House Amsterdam starts again at 09:00. Sessions close at 18:00, but the show isn’t over. At 19:00 the doors open at the Tolhuistuin club for our [Songs of the Living](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/DCAZCT-1) concert. This immersive performance, led by Toshi Reagon and a culmination of 3 community choirs and many local artists, is included in your festival ticket.
  
If you’re keen on singing, you can be part of this musical journey and join the choir rehearsals happening June 8 and 10 in Amsterdam and June 9 in Rotterdam. [Sign up here.](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/songs-of-the-living/)
