#### Using Zoom, Spatial Chat, or Mozilla Hubs

<details>
<summary>Do I need to download Zoom?</summary>
For sessions being delivered via Zoom, we recommend that you download and install the latest version of the Zoom client to your computer or mobile device. You may be prompted to review and approve permission for the Zoom app during set up, to access your camera and microphone for example, please make sure that you allow that permission when prompted. You can download Zoom directly from the website [HERE](https://zoom.us/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to install special software or hardware to use Spatial Chat or Mozilla Hubs?</summary>
Both Mozilla Hubs and Spatial Chat are designed to run directly within the browser. For the best possible experience, we recommend using a desktop or laptop computer and the latest version of [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and that you have as strong an internet connection as possible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need a camera and microphone to join a session?</summary>
We want MozFest sessions to be inclusive and participatory for those who join, so we’d recommend having access to a working camera and microphone for sessions taking place via Zoom, Spatial Chat, or Mozilla Hubs. You needn’t have your camera on or jump in where you aren’t comfortable, but we hope you’ll feel comfortable joining in where you can. If you don’t have access to either a camera or microphone, you may be able to join some Zoom sessions via telephone dial-in, please reach out for help in #Help and we’ll do our best to help. You can also look back at recorded sessions, watch the highlights on the main page, and view other experiences throughout the festival.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there a minimum internet requirement to join MozFest Sessions?</summary>
Not specifically, but some bandwidth intensive apps or session experiences may be more challenging for lower bandwidth users. We’d recommend WiFi over cellular if possible and try to ensure that all available household bandwidth is available for your use during the session. You can also try disabling “HD” settings in Zoom and turning your video off, to limit bandwidth consumption. If you have a particularly difficult time, please reach out to our volunteers in the #Help channel in the MozFest Slack, we’ll do our best to help!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Oh no! My Zoom app or web browser crashed or disconnected during my session, can I still participate?</summary>
It’s unfortunate, but these things can happen. If your session is still ongoing, you’ll be able to go back to the Plaza and access the same link again to join back in. 
</details>

#### Using Miro Board & Other Resources

<details>
<summary>Do I need to sign up for a Miro Board account?</summary>
No, if your session includes the use of a Miro Board, you’ll be provided with a link to that board either in the session itself or in the Plaza. You do not need to sign up for an account of any kind, but there are free Miro accounts if you’d choose to do so. If prompted otherwise, simply exit the prompt.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>I’m having difficulties with the Miro Board for my session!</summary>
Miro is a fantastic and feature rich whiteboard solution, but it can be a bit taxing on some devices. We’d recommend using a desktop or laptop computer over mobile if possible. You may also try closing unneeded apps or windows to conserve resources, if issues persist, you may wish to try rebooting your device entirely. It’s not unusual for large boards with many participants to require additional CPU resources. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>There was a specific file or resource shared within my session, how do I access it after the fact?</summary>
You should find all the links to any resources or files within the session listing, your facilitator will be sharing the links to those there. You can always reach out to them directly if you’d have any questions or believe something to be missing. 
</details>
