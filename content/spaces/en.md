## MozFest Community Slack

Slack is where the MozFest community continues important conversations online toward Trustworthy AI and internet health. You can find a channel for just about any topic you’re interested in – from #sustainability to #queering, from decentralization to global culture and heritage, from arts and culture to web literacy – and much, much more. These conversations last long after the festival has ended, keeping the momentum going all year long, from every corner of the globe. Connect, collaborate, and join the conversation.
