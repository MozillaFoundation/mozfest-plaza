# Emergent Sessions

%cover_image%

Sometimes you come up with a great idea for a session _during_ the festival. Hereâ€™s your chance to connect with others based on a spontaneous thought, a shared interest, a creative spark, a question or whatever else that inspires you!

Submit a new idea or high five an existing one. When multiple people share your interest, a session can emerge.

Leave your username of the [MozFest Slack](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/slack/) and you will be contacted to turn your idea into a session on the emergent schedule!

Happy sharing!
