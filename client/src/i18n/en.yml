    themeHeading: Thematic Focuses
    theme1:
      image: /themes/1-building-unified-futures.jpg
      title: Building Unified Futures
      content: >
        Technology, like the planet, belongs to us all. Building Unified Futures is reclaiming technology and thinking about different ways we can shape its future. We'll look at how to make new, meaningful connections, facilitate inclusivity, and work towards trustworthy AI that uplifts those historically shut out of tech. Together we're creating new possibilities and exploring how to build a future with AI that's truly accessible for us all.
    theme2:
      image: /themes/2-fair-and-inclusive-ai.jpg
      title: Fair and Inclusive AI
      content: >
        Technology can be fairer, and that's exactly what we're aiming for. We're bringing together people from different backgrounds across Europe to collaborate on AI solutions that are ethical, inclusive, and fair. Our focus is on ensuring transparency in both: the data utilized by AI and its development process. Fair and Inclusive AI will also explore how AI legislation can truly embody transparency and diversity.
    theme3:
      image: /themes/3-our-democratic-futures.jpg
      title: Our Democratic Futures
      content: >
        Globally, democracy is under threat, and AI has the potential to make it worse. We have the opportunity to rethink approaches to democracy in the age of AI so that it enhances transparency, fairness, and protects citizen rights. By prioritizing ethical considerations and inclusivity, we can build more engaged, informed, and democratic societies.
    theme4:
      image: /themes/4-planetary-justice.jpg
      title: Planetary Justice
      content: >
        We're challenging the conventional understanding of technology and the normative approach to resolving the planetary crises' we experience. Together, we are creating an ecosystem-driven understanding of the interconnectedness between our personal and communal well-being and actions, and an agenda to enact planetary justice in our digital futures.
